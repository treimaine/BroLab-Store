# Reservation System Test Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Checks

- âœ… Added authentication validation before making reservations
- âœ… Users must be signed in to make reservations
- âœ… Clear error messages for unauthenticated users

### 2. Data Validation Fixes

- âœ… Fixed phone number validation (minimum 10 characters required)
- âœ… Fixed service type validation (mixing_mastering â†’ mixing)
- âœ… Fixed lastName field (cannot be empty)
- âœ… All required fields properly validated

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- âœ… Added detailed console logging for debugging
- âœ… Better error messages showing actual API response
- âœ… Proper error type checking

### 4. Service Type Mapping

- âœ… Fixed service type enum validation
- âœ… Proper mapping between frontend and backend service types

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Authentication

1. Go to any service page (e.g., `/mixing-mastering`)
2. Try to submit without being signed in
3. Should see "Authentication Required" message

### 2. Test Mixing & Mastering Service

1. Sign in to your account
2. Go to `/mixing-mastering`
3. Fill out the form:
   - Select a service (mixing, mastering, or mixing+mastering)
   - Enter your name
   - Enter your email
   - Enter phone number (at least 10 digits)
   - Select preferred date (future date)
   - Select time slot
   - Enter project details
4. Submit the form
5. Check browser console for logs
6. Should see success message and redirect to checkout

### 3. Test Recording Sessions

1. Go to `/recording-sessions`
2. Fill out the form with valid data
3. Submit and check for success

### 4. Test Production Consultation

1. Go to `/production-consultation`
2. Fill out the form with valid data
3. Submit and check for success

## Debugging Information

### Console Logs to Look For

- `ðŸš€ Starting reservation submission...`
- `ðŸš€ Sending reservation data:` (shows the data being sent)
- `ðŸ“¡ Reservation response status:` (shows HTTP status code)
- `âœ… Reservation created successfully` (from backend)

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Authentication Required"

**Solution**: Make sure you're signed in with Clerk

#### Issue: "Failed to create reservation: 400"

**Possible causes:**

- Invalid phone number (less than 10 digits)
- Empty required fields
- Invalid service type
- Invalid date format

#### Issue: "Failed to create reservation: 401"

**Solution**: Authentication token issue - try signing out and back in

#### Issue: "Failed to create reservation: 500"

**Solution**: Server error - check server logs

## Expected Data Format

The frontend now sends data in this format:

```json
{
  "serviceType": "mixing",
  "clientInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890"
  },
  "preferredDate": "2024-01-15T14:00:00.000Z",
  "preferredDuration": 180,
  "serviceDetails": {
    "trackCount": 1,
    "genre": "hip-hop",
    "includeRevisions": 3,
    "rushDelivery": false
  },
  "notes": "Project details...",
  "budget": 15000,
  "acceptTerms": true
}
```

## Backend Processing

The backend now properly:

1. âœ… Validates the data against `CreateReservationSchema`
2. âœ… Transforms it to storage format (`InsertReservation`)
3. âœ… Saves to database
4. âœ… Sends confirmation email
5. âœ… Returns reservation data

## Next Steps

If reservations are still failing:

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Check server logs for backend errors
3. Verify user authentication status
4. Test with different form data
5. Check network tab for API request/response details

The reservation system should now work correctly across all service pages!
