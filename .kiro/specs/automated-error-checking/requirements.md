# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated error checking system that runs TypeScript compilation checks after any configuration changes or file edits. The system will provide immediate feedback on code quality and prevent errors from being introduced during development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic error checking after file modifications, so that I can catch TypeScript errors immediately without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TypeScript file is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically run TypeScript compilation checks
2. WHEN configuration files are changed THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and run relevant checks
3. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with file locations and line numbers
4. WHEN no errors are found THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation that the code is error-free

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable error checking rules, so that I can customize which files and types of errors to check.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the error checker THEN the system SHALL allow specifying file patterns to include or exclude
2. WHEN configuring the error checker THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling specific TypeScript checks
3. WHEN configuring the error checker THEN the system SHALL allow setting severity levels for different error types
4. IF a file matches exclusion patterns THEN the system SHALL skip error checking for that file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with the existing error handling system, so that compilation errors are tracked and managed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL integrate with the ErrorBoundaryManager
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL create ErrorLog entries with appropriate metadata
3. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically mark them as resolved in the error tracking system
4. WHEN error patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide recovery suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-optimized error checking, so that the development workflow is not slowed down by checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking large codebases THEN the system SHALL use incremental compilation for performance
2. WHEN multiple files change rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce checks to avoid excessive processing
3. WHEN running checks THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running operations
4. IF checks take longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL allow cancellation of the operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with development tools, so that error checking works seamlessly with my existing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using file watchers THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger checks on file changes
2. WHEN using build tools THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing build processes
3. WHEN using version control THEN the system SHALL run checks on pre-commit hooks
4. WHEN using CI/CD THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable output for automated processes
