# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to organize test files properly and fix TypeScript compilation errors in the codebase. The project currently has test files scattered in different locations and numerous TypeScript errors that prevent clean compilation. This cleanup will improve code maintainability, testing consistency, and development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to be consistently organized in the **tests** directory, so that I can easily locate and manage tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN all .test.ts files SHALL be located in the **tests** directory or its subdirectories
2. WHEN a test file exists outside **tests** THEN it SHALL be moved to the appropriate location within **tests**
3. WHEN moving test files THEN their import paths SHALL be updated to maintain functionality
4. WHEN test files are moved THEN any references to them in configuration files SHALL be updated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript compilation to succeed without errors, so that I can have confidence in the code quality and type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` THEN the command SHALL complete without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN TypeScript errors exist in audit logging THEN they SHALL be fixed by correcting the audit schema types
3. WHEN TypeScript errors exist in Convex functions THEN they SHALL be resolved by fixing type mismatches
4. WHEN TypeScript errors exist in server routes THEN they SHALL be corrected by updating API version compatibility and property access
5. WHEN TypeScript errors exist due to missing properties THEN they SHALL be resolved by adding required properties or making them optional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test file naming and structure, so that the testing framework can discover and run all tests reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are organized THEN they SHALL follow the pattern **tests**/\*_/_.test.ts
2. WHEN test files have dependencies THEN their relative import paths SHALL be correctly updated
3. WHEN test configuration exists THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect the new test file locations
4. WHEN running tests THEN all moved test files SHALL be discoverable by the test runner

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want audit logging to work correctly with proper TypeScript types, so that system monitoring and debugging are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit events are logged THEN the details object SHALL conform to the expected schema
2. WHEN audit functions are called THEN they SHALL not produce TypeScript compilation errors
3. WHEN custom audit properties are used THEN they SHALL be properly typed in the audit schema
4. WHEN audit logging fails THEN it SHALL not break the application functionality
