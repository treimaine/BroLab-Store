# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses code quality issues identified in the codebase, including typographical errors in documentation, incorrect environment variable usage in health routes, misleading route comments, and unsafe test code patterns. These issues affect code maintainability, observability, and test reliability.

## Glossary

- **System**: The BroLab Entertainment beats marketplace application
- **Health Route**: API endpoint that returns system health status and configuration information
- **Clerk Payment Guide**: Documentation example response in Clerk integration code
- **Verify-Email Route**: API endpoint for email verification functionality
- **Rate Limiter Test**: Unit test for rate limiting functionality
- **Environment Variable**: Configuration value accessed via process.env
- **HTTP Verb**: Request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- **Key Generator**: Function that generates unique identifiers for rate limiting
- **Test Code**: Automated test implementation using Jest framework

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Documentation Typo in Clerk Payment Guide

**User Story:** As a developer reading the Clerk payment integration code, I want accurate spelling in documentation examples, so that I can trust the code quality and professionalism of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System displays an error message in the Clerk payment setup guide example response, THE System SHALL spell "occurred" correctly with two 'r' characters
2. THE System SHALL update the example response from "Error occured" to "Error occurred"
3. THE System SHALL maintain all other aspects of the example response unchanged
4. THE System SHALL ensure the fix is applied to the correct file location in the codebase

### Requirement 2: Correct Environment Variable Names in Health Routes

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring application health, I want health endpoints to return accurate configuration values, so that I can properly observe and debug the system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System retrieves the Node environment value in health routes, THE System SHALL use the correct environment variable name "NODE_ENV"
2. WHEN THE System retrieves the npm package version in health routes, THE System SHALL use the correct environment variable name "npm_package_version"
3. WHEN THE System retrieves the Clerk secret key status in health routes, THE System SHALL use the correct environment variable name "CLERK_SECRET_KEY"
4. THE System SHALL replace incorrect variable names "NODEENV", "npmpackage_version", and "CLERKSECRET_KEY" with their correct equivalents
5. THE System SHALL ensure health route responses display actual configuration values instead of undefined

### Requirement 3: Align Route Comment with HTTP Verb

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the API codebase, I want route comments to accurately reflect the HTTP method used, so that I can quickly understand the API structure without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System declares the verify-email route handler with router.get(), THE System SHALL document the route comment as "GET /api/email/verify-email"
2. THE System SHALL replace the misleading "POST /api/email/verify-email" comment with the correct GET method
3. THE System SHALL maintain consistency between route declaration and route documentation
4. THE System SHALL ensure internal documentation accurately reflects the actual HTTP verb used

### Requirement 4: Fix Unsafe Custom Key Generator in Rate Limiter Test

**User Story:** As a developer running the test suite, I want rate limiter tests to execute safely without throwing errors, so that I can validate rate limiting functionality reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System defines a custom key generator function in rate limiter integration tests, THE System SHALL provide a valid function signature that accepts an \_id parameter of type string
2. WHEN THE System executes the custom key generator, THE System SHALL return a string value derived from the \_id parameter
3. THE System SHALL replace the unsafe `custom:${id}` reference with the correct `custom:${_id}` parameter reference
4. THE System SHALL ensure the test executes without throwing "id is not defined" errors
5. THE System SHALL maintain test validity by using the actual parameter name defined in the function signature
