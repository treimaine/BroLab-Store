# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The reservation system for BroLab Entertainment services (Mixing & Mastering, Recording Sessions, Custom Beats, Production Consultation) has multiple issues. While some services like Recording Sessions and Production Consultation work correctly, the Custom Beats service is failing to properly redirect users to checkout for payment completion. The Custom Beats service creates reservations but doesn't create payment intents, uses hardcoded user data, and lacks proper authentication checks. Additionally, the mailing system needs to be upgraded to ensure proper integration and notifications throughout the reservation flow.
