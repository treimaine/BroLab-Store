## ✅ MAJOR PROGRESS COMPLETED

**Core Reservation System:** ✅ WORKING

- Convex reservation functions handle authentication properly
- Server routes use correct Clerk IDs and data transformation
- Schema field name mismatch resolved (referenceLinks vs reference_links)
- Enhanced email service with retry logic and professional templates
- All reservation tests passing (74/74)

**Current Status Analysis:**

✅ **Working Services:**

- Recording Sessions: Full reservation + payment flow working
- Production Consultation: Full reservation + payment flow working
- Mixing & Mastering: Full reservation + payment flow working

⚠️ **Partially Working:**

- Custom Beats: Creates reservations but missing payment intent creation
  - Uses authenticated user data ✅
  - Creates reservation successfully ✅
  - Missing payment intent creation ❌
  - Uses simple session storage format (no clientSecret) ❌

**Key Issue Identified:**
Custom Beats service creates reservations but doesn't create Stripe payment intents, so users can't complete payment. Other services (mixing-mastering) create both reservation AND payment intent before redirecting to checkout.

**Files Needing Updates:**

- `client/src/pages/custom-beats.tsx` - Add payment intent creation after reservation
- Session storage format needs clientSecret for payment processing
