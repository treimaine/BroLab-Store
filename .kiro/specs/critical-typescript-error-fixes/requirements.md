# Critical TypeScript Error Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BroLab Entertainment application currently has 108 TypeScript errors across 25 files that are preventing the frontend from starting. These errors need to be systematically resolved to restore application functionality and enable development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Startup Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start without TypeScript compilation errors, so that I can access the frontend and continue development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server is started THEN the application SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN the frontend is accessed THEN the application SHALL load successfully in the browser
3. WHEN TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN all files SHALL pass compilation without warnings
4. IF any critical errors remain THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with resolution guidance

### Requirement 2: Component Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React components to have proper TypeScript interfaces, so that I can work with type-safe code and catch errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are imported THEN they SHALL have properly defined prop interfaces
2. WHEN component state is used THEN it SHALL be properly typed with explicit interfaces
3. WHEN hooks are called THEN they SHALL return properly typed values
4. IF a component uses external data THEN it SHALL validate the data structure with proper types

### Requirement 3: API and Service Type Definitions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API calls and service functions to be properly typed, so that I can ensure data consistency and catch integration errors early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API functions are called THEN they SHALL have typed request and response interfaces
2. WHEN service functions are used THEN they SHALL have explicit parameter and return types
3. WHEN external library functions are called THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions or declarations
4. IF type definitions are missing THEN custom type declarations SHALL be created

### Requirement 4: Import and Module Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all imports to resolve correctly, so that the module bundler can build the application successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files import other modules THEN all import paths SHALL resolve correctly
2. WHEN TypeScript compiles THEN all module references SHALL be found
3. WHEN external libraries are imported THEN they SHALL have accessible type definitions
4. IF import paths are incorrect THEN they SHALL be updated to use proper relative or alias paths

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling throughout the application, so that runtime errors are caught and handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions can throw errors THEN they SHALL have proper error type definitions
2. WHEN validation is performed THEN it SHALL use typed validation schemas
3. WHEN error boundaries are used THEN they SHALL handle typed error objects
4. IF runtime errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly typed and handled

### Requirement 6: Build Process Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully, so that I can deploy the application to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is run THEN it SHALL complete without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN the production build is created THEN all type checking SHALL pass
3. WHEN the application is bundled THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly resolved
4. IF build errors occur THEN they SHALL provide clear guidance for resolution
