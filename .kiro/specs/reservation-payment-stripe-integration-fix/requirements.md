# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The reservation system currently has a critical payment integration issue where users are not properly redirected to Stripe for payment processing. Instead, they see a fake success page without completing actual payment. This creates a serious business problem where services are reserved but not paid for, leading to revenue loss and operational confusion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer who has reserved a service (Mixing & Mastering, Recording Session, etc.), I want to be redirected to Stripe's secure checkout page when I proceed to payment, so that I can complete my purchase with real payment processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a service reservation THEN they SHALL be redirected to the checkout page with their service in the pending payment state
2. WHEN a user clicks "Complete Payment" on the checkout page THEN the system SHALL create a valid Stripe checkout session
3. WHEN the Stripe checkout session is created THEN the user SHALL be redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout page
4. WHEN the user completes payment on Stripe THEN they SHALL be redirected back to the success page with confirmed payment status
5. WHEN the payment is successful THEN the reservation status SHALL be updated to "confirmed" or "paid"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the payment flow to handle both individual services and combined cart items (services + beats), so that I can purchase multiple items in a single transaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has both pending services and cart items THEN the checkout SHALL combine both into a single Stripe session
2. WHEN creating the checkout session THEN the system SHALL include proper line items for each service and beat
3. WHEN the payment is completed THEN both services and beats SHALL be processed and delivered appropriately
4. WHEN there are multiple items THEN the metadata SHALL include detailed information about each item type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and fallback mechanisms in the payment flow, so that users receive clear feedback when payment issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Stripe API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
2. WHEN a checkout session creation fails THEN the user SHALL be informed and given options to retry
3. WHEN a user cancels payment on Stripe THEN they SHALL be redirected back to the checkout page with their items preserved
4. WHEN payment fails THEN the reservation status SHALL remain "pending" and the user SHALL be notified
5. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and clear error messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want proper webhook handling for payment confirmations, so that reservations are automatically confirmed when payments are successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Stripe webhook indicates successful payment THEN the system SHALL update the reservation status automatically
2. WHEN payment is confirmed THEN the system SHALL send confirmation emails to the customer
3. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide manual reconciliation options
4. WHEN duplicate webhooks are received THEN the system SHALL handle them idempotently without double-processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer, I want my payment session to be secure and properly authenticated, so that my payment information is protected and linked to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a checkout session THEN the system SHALL validate user authentication
2. WHEN processing payment THEN the system SHALL include proper user identification in metadata
3. WHEN payment is completed THEN the system SHALL link the payment to the correct user account
4. WHEN storing payment data THEN the system SHALL follow PCI compliance best practices
5. IF authentication expires during checkout THEN the user SHALL be prompted to re-authenticate
