# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BroLab Entertainment application is experiencing critical build failures due to duplicate export declarations in the configuration system. The `client/src/config/dashboard.ts` file contains multiple export conflicts that prevent the Vite development server from starting, blocking all frontend development work. This feature addresses the immediate configuration errors and establishes a robust configuration management system to prevent similar issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration system to have clean, non-conflicting exports, so that the development server can start successfully and I can continue working on the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server is started THEN the system SHALL compile without any duplicate export errors
2. WHEN configuration files are imported THEN the system SHALL provide access to all configuration constants without conflicts
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the system SHALL pass without any export declaration conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized configuration management system, so that all application settings are organized, type-safe, and easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration constants are defined THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions and export patterns
2. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe getters with proper defaults
3. WHEN configuration is validated THEN the system SHALL check for required environment variables and valid value ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused code to be removed from configuration files, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused helper functions
2. WHEN ESLint runs on configuration files THEN the system SHALL pass without unused variable warnings
3. WHEN configuration exports are reviewed THEN the system SHALL only export necessary constants and functions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration validation to work properly, so that I can catch configuration errors early in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN configuration values are out of range THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings
3. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration system to be well-documented and tested, so that future changes can be made safely without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration functions are created THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive JSDoc comments
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL have corresponding unit tests to verify behavior
3. WHEN new configuration options are added THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns and conventions
