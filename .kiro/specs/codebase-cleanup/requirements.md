# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to clean up the BroLab Entertainment codebase by identifying and removing unused functions, components, and files that do not contribute to the application's functionality. The cleanup will improve maintainability, reduce bundle size, and eliminate technical debt.

## Glossary

- **Component** - React functional component (.tsx files) that renders UI elements
- **Function** - TypeScript/JavaScript functions in utility files, services, or hooks
- **Unused Code** - Code that is not imported, referenced, or executed in the application
- **Dead Code** - Code that cannot be reached during execution
- **Bundle Size** - The total size of JavaScript/CSS files delivered to the browser
- **Technical Debt** - Code that needs refactoring or removal to maintain code quality

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused components and functions from the codebase, so that the application has better performance and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase, THE System SHALL identify all components that are not imported or used in any other files
2. WHEN analyzing the codebase, THE System SHALL identify all functions that are not called or referenced anywhere
3. WHEN analyzing the codebase, THE System SHALL identify all utility files that are not imported by any other files
4. WHEN removing unused code, THE System SHALL preserve all code that is actually used in the application
5. WHEN removing unused code, THE System SHALL maintain all critical functionality and user-facing features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up example and debug components, so that the production bundle only contains necessary code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying example components, THE System SHALL remove all files in the examples directory that are not used in production
2. WHEN identifying debug components, THE System SHALL remove debug components that are not used in the main application flow
3. WHEN removing example code, THE System SHALL preserve any examples that are actually used in the application
4. WHEN removing debug code, THE System SHALL preserve debug functionality that is used in development builds
5. WHERE development-only code exists, THE System SHALL ensure it is properly conditionally loaded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused diagnostic and monitoring components, so that the codebase is cleaner and more focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing diagnostic components, THE System SHALL identify components like ActivitySyncDiagnostic that are not imported anywhere
2. WHEN analyzing monitoring components, THE System SHALL preserve components that are used in the main App.tsx or other critical paths
3. WHEN removing diagnostic components, THE System SHALL ensure no functionality is broken in the dashboard
4. WHEN removing monitoring components, THE System SHALL preserve performance monitoring that is actually used
5. IF diagnostic components are needed for debugging, THEN THE System SHALL document their purpose and usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up unused hooks and services, so that the codebase has better organization and reduced complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing hooks directory, THE System SHALL identify hooks that are not imported or used
2. WHEN analyzing services directory, THE System SHALL identify service classes that are not instantiated or called
3. WHEN removing unused hooks, THE System SHALL preserve all hooks that are used in components or other hooks
4. WHEN removing unused services, THE System SHALL preserve all services that are used in the application logic
5. WHEN cleaning up services, THE System SHALL maintain all business logic and API integrations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused utility functions and configuration files, so that the codebase is more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing utility files, THE System SHALL identify functions that are not imported or called
2. WHEN analyzing configuration files, THE System SHALL identify configs that are not used in the application
3. WHEN removing utility functions, THE System SHALL preserve all functions that are used directly or indirectly
4. WHEN removing configuration files, THE System SHALL preserve all configs that are required for the application to function
5. WHEN cleaning up utilities, THE System SHALL maintain all helper functions that support core functionality
