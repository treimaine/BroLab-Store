# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the AnalyticsDashboard component including TypeScript compilation errors and improper CSS file organization. The component currently has errors related to missing methods in the useAnalytics hook and the CSS file is located in the wrong directory according to project conventions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AnalyticsDashboard component to compile without TypeScript errors, so that the analytics system functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the useAnalytics hook THEN the component SHALL only use methods that exist in the UseAnalyticsReturn interface
2. WHEN the component references getRealTimeMetrics THEN it SHALL be removed since this method does not exist in the hook
3. WHEN the component destructures the hook return THEN it SHALL only include available methods and properties
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the AnalyticsDashboard component SHALL produce no compilation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS files to be organized according to project conventions, so that the codebase maintains consistency and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS files are created for components THEN they SHALL be placed in the client/src/styles/ directory
2. WHEN the AnalyticsDashboard.css file exists in client/src/components/ THEN it SHALL be moved to client/src/styles/
3. WHEN CSS files are moved THEN the import statements in components SHALL be updated to reflect the new location
4. WHEN CSS files are in the styles directory THEN they SHALL follow the naming convention matching the component name

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AnalyticsDashboard component to use the correct CSS import path, so that styling is applied properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AnalyticsDashboard component imports CSS THEN it SHALL import from the client/src/styles/ directory
2. WHEN the CSS import path is updated THEN the component SHALL continue to render with proper styling
3. WHEN the CSS file is moved THEN no duplicate CSS files SHALL remain in the old location
4. WHEN the component loads THEN all CSS classes SHALL be available and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AnalyticsDashboard component to function correctly with the available analytics methods, so that users can view analytics data without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component needs real-time metrics THEN it SHALL use the realTimeMetrics property from the hook
2. WHEN the component needs to refresh data THEN it SHALL use available methods like getDashboardData
3. WHEN the component handles analytics functionality THEN it SHALL not reference non-existent methods
4. WHEN users interact with the dashboard THEN all features SHALL work without JavaScript errors
