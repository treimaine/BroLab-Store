# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors in AnalyticsDashboard component
  - Remove the non-existent `getRealTimeMetrics` method from useAnalytics hook destructuring
  - Update the destructuring assignment to only include available methods and properties
  - Verify the component continues to function correctly with the `realTimeMetrics` property
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Move CSS file to correct directory location
  - Move `client/src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.css` to `client/src/styles/analytics-dashboard.css`
  - Verify the CSS file content is preserved during the move
  - Check if `client/src/styles/analytics-dashboard.css` already exists and handle conflicts
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Update CSS import path in AnalyticsDashboard component
  - Modify the CSS import statement to reference the new file location
  - Change from `"./AnalyticsDashboard.css"` to `"../../styles/analytics-dashboard.css"`
  - Ensure the import path is correct relative to the component location
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Clean up old CSS file location
  - Remove the old `client/src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.css` file
  - Verify no other components reference the old CSS file location
  - Ensure no duplicate CSS files remain in the codebase
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Validate TypeScript compilation and component functionality
  - Run TypeScript compilation check to verify no errors remain
  - Test the AnalyticsDashboard component renders correctly with proper styling
  - Verify all analytics functionality works without JavaScript errors
  - Confirm real-time metrics display correctly using the available hook properties
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4, 4.1, 4.4_
