# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines a comprehensive system optimization initiative to address critical performance issues, enhance security measures, improve user experience, and implement advanced features. The project is structured in three phases over three weeks, prioritizing immediate fixes while building toward advanced capabilities. The system currently faces performance bottlenecks, unclear error handling, type safety issues, and missing functionality that impacts user experience and system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast and responsive application performance, so that I can efficiently interact with the platform without delays or memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs user synchronization THEN it SHALL implement debounced sync to prevent excessive API calls
2. WHEN data is requested frequently THEN the system SHALL implement caching mechanisms to reduce load times
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL prevent memory leaks identified in testsprite results
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL implement code splitting to optimize initial bundle size
5. IF sync operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate sync requests

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and helpful error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL handle 404 errors for missing API endpoints
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information for debugging
5. IF retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or graceful degradation

### Requirement 3: Type Safety and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe code with proper interfaces, so that I can maintain and extend the system with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code uses data types THEN it SHALL replace all 'any' types with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN API responses are handled THEN the system SHALL validate data against defined schemas
3. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL have explicit return types and parameter types
4. WHEN data flows through the system THEN it SHALL maintain type safety end-to-end
5. IF type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL catch them at compile time

### Requirement 4: Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security measures in place, so that the platform is protected against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhooks are received THEN the system SHALL implement enhanced validation mechanisms
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. WHEN user authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL validate all security tokens properly
4. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log security events for audit
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate countermeasures

### Requirement 5: User Experience Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth interactions with clear feedback, so that I can use the platform effectively even with poor connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
2. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL provide offline support for critical functions
3. WHEN data is being updated THEN the system SHALL implement optimistic updates for immediate feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options to the user
5. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle intermittent connections

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics, so that I can track system performance and user behavior effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL implement structured logging
2. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL track and categorize error patterns
3. WHEN users interact with the platform THEN the system SHALL collect behavior analytics
4. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance tracking
5. IF system issues arise THEN monitoring SHALL provide early warning alerts

### Requirement 7: Data Consistency and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to remain consistent and recoverable, so that I don't lose information due to system conflicts or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL implement conflict resolution mechanisms
2. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities
3. WHEN data is synchronized THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency across all sources
4. WHEN concurrent updates happen THEN the system SHALL handle them without data corruption
5. IF data integrity is compromised THEN the system SHALL detect and repair inconsistencies

### Requirement 8: API Completeness

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the system, I want all necessary API endpoints to be available and functional, so that I can build complete features without encountering missing routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN all documented routes SHALL be implemented and functional
2. WHEN 404 errors occur THEN missing endpoints SHALL be identified and implemented
3. WHEN API documentation is referenced THEN all endpoints SHALL match their specifications
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN all API routes SHALL respond appropriately
5. IF new endpoints are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented following established patterns
