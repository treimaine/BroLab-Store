# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for modernizing and upgrading the BroLab Entertainment user dashboard. The current dashboard suffers from architectural issues including excessive lazy loading, type casting problems, inconsistent data fetching, and poor user experience. This modernization effort aims to create a unified, performant, and maintainable dashboard system with real-time capabilities and improved user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Data Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, optimized data layer for the dashboard, so that I can eliminate redundant queries and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL use a single unified data hook instead of multiple overlapping hooks
2. WHEN fetching dashboard data THEN the system SHALL perform optimized database joins instead of separate queries
3. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL return properly typed responses without type casting
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL skip data queries gracefully
5. WHEN data changes THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates without full page refreshes

### Requirement 2: Component Architecture Simplification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified component structure, so that the codebase is more maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering the dashboard THEN the system SHALL eliminate unnecessary lazy loading components
2. WHEN components are structured THEN the system SHALL follow a clear hierarchy with proper separation of concerns
3. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN the system SHALL maintain strict typing without explicit any types
4. WHEN state is managed THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns across all components
5. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL minimize re-renders through optimized dependency arrays

### Requirement 3: Enhanced User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent loading states and better error handling, so that I have a smooth dashboard experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is loading THEN the system SHALL display consistent skeleton components
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL show actionable error messages with retry options
3. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL provide clear loading indicators
4. WHEN the dashboard is responsive THEN the system SHALL work consistently across all device sizes
5. WHEN animations are used THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions with configurable durations

### Requirement 4: Real-time Data Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates on my dashboard, so that I can see changes immediately without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes in the system THEN the dashboard SHALL update automatically in real-time
2. WHEN favorites are added or removed THEN the system SHALL update the UI optimistically
3. WHEN orders are placed THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately
4. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show connection status and attempt reconnection
5. WHEN real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to periodic polling

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast dashboard loading times, so that I can access my information quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads initially THEN the system SHALL complete loading 50% faster than current implementation
2. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cache invalidation
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use optimized database indexes
4. WHEN bundle size is considered THEN the system SHALL reduce unnecessary code through proper lazy loading
5. WHEN concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL limit and manage request queuing

### Requirement 6: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration management, so that settings can be easily maintained and environment-specific.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are needed THEN the system SHALL use centralized configuration files
2. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL support environment-based feature flags
3. WHEN API endpoints are configured THEN the system SHALL use consistent URL management
4. WHEN UI settings are needed THEN the system SHALL provide configurable animation and display options
5. WHEN performance settings are required THEN the system SHALL allow tunable cache and request parameters

### Requirement 7: Internationalization and Currency Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper currency formatting and language support, so that the dashboard displays information in my preferred format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN currency is displayed THEN the system SHALL use proper currency formatting with symbols
2. WHEN language is selected THEN the system SHALL display all text in the chosen language
3. WHEN numbers are formatted THEN the system SHALL respect locale-specific formatting rules
4. WHEN dates are shown THEN the system SHALL use consistent date formatting across components
5. WHEN currency conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL handle cents vs dollars consistently

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Statistics and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive statistics and trend analysis, so that I can understand my usage patterns and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show favorites, downloads, orders, and revenue metrics
2. WHEN trends are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide period-over-period comparisons
3. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL display interactive analytics with multiple time periods
4. WHEN data is aggregated THEN the system SHALL provide accurate calculations without hardcoded values
5. WHEN metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time

### Requirement 9: Improved Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling, so that I can recover from issues and continue using the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and retry mechanisms
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL guide users to re-authenticate
3. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL offer manual refresh options
4. WHEN errors are persistent THEN the system SHALL provide escalation paths or support contact
5. WHEN recovery is attempted THEN the system SHALL track retry attempts and prevent infinite loops

### Requirement 10: Accessibility and Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the dashboard to be fully accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality
4. WHEN color is used for information THEN the system SHALL provide alternative indicators
5. WHEN contrast is considered THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG accessibility guidelines
