# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines requirements for fixing critical issues identified by TestSprite AI testing on October 28, 2025. The testing revealed a 40% pass rate (6/15 tests), with 9 critical failures blocking core business functionality including authentication, shopping cart persistence, product catalog, subscription management, and payment processing. These fixes are essential for production readiness and revenue generation.

The application uses React 18 with Vite 5.4+, Clerk for authentication, Convex for real-time database, Zustand for client state, and TanStack Query for server state caching. The cart currently uses Zustand with localStorage persistence but lacks Convex synchronization for authenticated users.

### Working Features (Verified by TestSprite)

The following features are already functional and should be preserved during fixes:

- **Favorites & Wishlist Synchronization** (TC017 ✅ Passed): Real-time sync across sessions and devices using Convex
- **Real-time Dashboard Data** (TC022 ✅ Passed): Dashboard updates without page reload via Convex subscriptions
- **Error Handling & Logging** (TC023 ✅ Passed): Error boundaries and server-side logging functional
- **Offline Support** (TC019 ✅ Passed): Offline detection and graceful degradation working
- **SEO Optimization** (TC020 ✅ Passed): Meta tags and schema markup properly implemented
- **Admin Panel** (TC021 ✅ Passed): Access control and basic functionality operational
- **Cross-browser Compatibility** (TC024 ✅ Passed): Consistent rendering and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Critical Failures Requiring Fixes

The following features require immediate attention:

1. **Clerk Authentication** (TC010 ❌ Failed): 400 errors from environment endpoint, deprecated redirectUrl prop
2. **Product Catalog** (TC011 ❌ Failed): Vite dependency optimization issues with @radix-ui/react-progress
3. **Shopping Cart Persistence** (TC013 ❌ Failed): Cart not persisting across logout/login cycles
4. **Subscription Management** (TC016 ❌ Failed): Clerk Billing integration not properly configured
5. **Audio Playback** (TC012 ❌ Timeout): WaveSurfer.js initialization blocking
6. **Payment Processing** (TC014 ❌ Timeout): Dependent on cart persistence fix
7. **Service Reservations** (TC015 ❌ Timeout): Form validation or email notification issues
8. **File Upload** (TC018 ❌ Failed): Camera icon not triggering file input dialog

**Current Status:** ❌ Failed (TC010). Root causes identified:

- Clerk development keys causing 400 errors on environment endpoint
- Deprecated `redirectUrl` prop used in client/src/pages/login.tsx (lines 42 and 62)
- ClerkProvider already has telemetry disabled in client/src/main.tsx (line 60)

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the registration form, THE System SHALL complete registration without 400 errors from Clerk environment endpoint by using production keys or requesting increased development limits
2. WHEN the System initializes SignIn and SignUp components in client/src/pages/login.tsx, THE System SHALL replace deprecated `redirectUrl` prop with `fallbackRedirectUrl` on lines 42 and 62
3. THE System SHALL maintain telemetry: false setting in ClerkProvider at client/src/main.tsx line 60
4. IF Clerk development keys exceed rate limits, THEN THE System SHALL display a user-friendly error message with retry option using toast notification
5. WHEN Clerk API calls fail, THE System SHALL log the error with context including endpoint, status code, and user action to convex/audit.ts

6. WHEN a file upload succeeds, THE System SHALL update user.imageUrl field in Convex users table and refresh Clerk user metadata within 10 seconds
7. THE System SHALL implement file input element with accept attribute set to "image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp" for browser-level validation
8. THE System SHALL verify camera icon click handler is properly attached and not overridden by Clerk UserProfile component

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want pages to load quickly with stable layouts, so that I have a smooth browsing experience.

**Current Status:** Partially implemented. Code splitting and lazy loading are already in place in client/src/App.tsx. Performance utilities exist in client/src/utils/performance.ts. However, FCP >3s, LCP >4s, and CLS 0.216-0.376 exceed targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads any page, THE System SHALL achieve First Contentful Paint below 1.8 seconds by optimizing preloadCriticalResources() function in client/src/utils/performance.ts
2. WHEN a user loads any page, THE System SHALL achieve Largest Contentful Paint below 2.5 seconds by converting hero-bg.jpg and logo.png to WebP format with compression
3. WHEN a page renders, THE System SHALL maintain Cumulative Layout Shift below 0.1 by adding explicit width and height attributes to all images
4. THE System SHALL preload critical resources using link rel="preload" in client/index.html for hero-bg.webp, logo.webp, and critical CSS

6. THE System SHALL verify code splitting for routes using React.lazy() in client/src/App.tsx maintains initial bundle size below 200 kilobytes
7. WHEN Vite builds the application, THE System SHALL verify tree shaking and minification in vite.config.ts are enabled with preset: "smallest"

### Requirement 9: Audio Playback Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want audio playback functionality to be testable, so that I can verify WaveSurfer.js integration works correctly.

**Current Status:** ❌ Timeout (TC012). Root causes identified:

- Test execution timed out after 15 minutes
- Likely related to product catalog page crash (TC011) preventing navigation to audio player
- WaveSurfer.js initialization may be blocking
- EnhancedGlobalAudioPlayer component exists in client/src/components/audio/EnhancedGlobalAudioPlayer.tsx
- Component is lazy loaded in client/src/App.tsx with 2 second preload delay

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WaveSurfer.js initializes in client/src/components/audio/EnhancedGlobalAudioPlayer.tsx, THE System SHALL complete initialization within 2 seconds with async/await pattern
2. IF audio file loading exceeds 10 seconds, THEN THE System SHALL timeout and display a loading error message via toast notification
3. WHEN an audio file loads, THE System SHALL display a loading state with progress indicator using Radix UI Progress component
4. WHEN a component with WaveSurfer.js unmounts, THE System SHALL call wavesurfer.destroy() to cleanup audio instances and prevent memory leaks
5. THE System SHALL implement timeout handling using Promise.race with setTimeout for 10 second limit for audio file loading to prevent indefinite hangs
6. WHEN WaveSurfer.js initialization fails, THE System SHALL catch the error in ErrorBoundary and display fallback UI without crashing the page
7. THE System SHALL fix product catalog issues (Requirement 2) first to enable navigation to audio player for testing

### Requirement 10: Error Boundary Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want component errors to be handled gracefully, so that one error doesn't crash the entire application.

**Current Status:** ✅ Functional. TestSprite TC023 confirmed error boundaries handle component errors correctly. ErrorBoundary component exists in client/src/components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx and is properly wrapped around Router in client/src/App.tsx.

#### Acceptance Criteria (Verification & Enhancement)

1. WHEN a lazy-loaded component fails to load in client/src/App.tsx, THE System SHALL display an error message within ErrorBoundary component from client/src/components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx
2. WHEN an error boundary catches an error, THE System SHALL log the error with component stack trace to convex/audit.ts using logActivity mutation
3. WHEN an error occurs in a component, THE System SHALL display a user-friendly error message with a retry button using ErrorBoundary fallback UI
4. WHEN a user clicks the retry button, THE System SHALL reset error boundary state and attempt to reload the failed component
5. THE System SHALL maintain ErrorBoundary wrapper around Router component in client/src/App.tsx to catch all route-level errors
6. WHEN an error occurs in a Suspense boundary, THE System SHALL display RouteLoadingFallback component from client/src/components/loading/OptimizedLoadingFallback.tsx instead of crashing
7. WHEN fixing other requirements, THE System SHALL preserve existing error boundary functionality to maintain TC023 pass status
