# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BroLab Beats Store project has several configuration errors that are preventing proper development workflow. These errors include TypeScript compilation issues, missing ESLint dependencies, incorrect Convex function references, and potential package.json inconsistencies. This specification addresses the systematic resolution of these configuration problems to ensure a stable development environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript compilation to work without errors, so that I can develop and build the application successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL complete without TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN using Convex client methods THEN the system SHALL use proper function references instead of string literals
3. WHEN importing Convex functions THEN the system SHALL use the generated API types correctly
4. IF Convex functions don't exist THEN the system SHALL create placeholder functions or update references

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint to run properly, so that I can maintain code quality and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL execute ESLint without module resolution errors
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL have all required dependencies installed
3. WHEN using React rules THEN the system SHALL have proper React ESLint plugin configuration
4. IF ESLint dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL install the required packages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want package.json to have consistent and valid dependencies, so that the project installs and runs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN the system SHALL have no invalid or conflicting dependencies
2. WHEN running npm install THEN the system SHALL install all dependencies without warnings
3. WHEN dependencies have version conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them to compatible versions
4. IF there are unused dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove them to reduce bundle size

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Jest configuration to work properly, so that I can run tests successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN the system SHALL execute tests without configuration errors
2. WHEN Jest loads modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all module mappings correctly
3. WHEN testing TypeScript files THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript configuration
4. IF Jest configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL resolve them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build tools to work correctly, so that I can build and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete the build process successfully
2. WHEN Vite processes files THEN the system SHALL resolve all imports and aliases correctly
3. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized output
4. IF build configuration has errors THEN the system SHALL fix them
