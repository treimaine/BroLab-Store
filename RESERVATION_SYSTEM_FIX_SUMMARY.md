# Reservation System Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The reservation system was failing with a Convex schema validation error:

```
Object contains extra field `reference_links` that is not in the validator.
Path: .details
Object: {..., reference_links: [], ...}
Validator: {..., referenceLinks: v.optional(v.array(v.string())), ...}
```

## Root Cause

There was a **field name mismatch** between:

- **Convex Schema**: Expected `referenceLinks` (camelCase)
- **Server Code**: Was sending `reference_links` (snake_case)

## Files Fixed

### 1. `server/routes/reservations.ts`

**Changed:**

```typescript
details: {
  // ...
  reference_links: [],  // ❌ Wrong
}
```

**To:**

```typescript
details: {
  // ...
  referenceLinks: [],   // ✅ Correct
}
```

### 2. `shared/schema.ts`

**Updated the TypeScript interface to match Convex:**

```typescript
details: {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  requirements?: string;
  referenceLinks?: string[];  // ✅ Changed from reference_links
};
```

**Updated the Zod validation schema:**

```typescript
details: z.object({
  // ...
  referenceLinks: z.array(z.string().url()).optional(),  // ✅ Changed from reference_links
}),
```

### 3. `__tests__/reservation-creation-fix.test.ts`

**Updated test expectations to use correct field names:**

```typescript
// Changed all instances of reference_links to referenceLinks
```

## Verification

### Tests Created

1. **`__tests__/reservation-schema-validation.test.ts`** - Validates schema consistency
2. **Existing tests updated** - All reservation tests now pass

### Test Results

```bash
✅ All reservation tests passing
✅ Schema validation working correctly
✅ Field name consistency verified
```

## Technical Details

### Convex Schema (Correct)

```typescript
details: v.object({
  name: v.string(),
  email: v.string(),
  phone: v.string(),
  requirements: v.optional(v.string()),
  referenceLinks: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),  // camelCase
  // ... other fields
}),
```

### Data Flow (Fixed)

```
Client Request → Server Validation → Data Transformation → Convex Mutation
                                           ↓
                              referenceLinks: []  ✅
                         (not reference_links: [])
```

## Impact

- ✅ **Users can now successfully create reservations**
- ✅ **Payment flow will work after reservation creation**
- ✅ **No more Convex schema validation errors**
- ✅ **Consistent field naming across the entire stack**

## Prevention

- **Type Safety**: The shared schema now enforces consistent field names
- **Tests**: Added validation tests to catch similar issues
- **Documentation**: Clear field naming conventions established

## Next Steps

The reservation system is now fully functional. Users should be able to:

1. Fill out the reservation form
2. Submit the reservation successfully
3. Proceed to payment
4. Receive confirmation emails

The fix resolves the core issue preventing reservation creation and payment processing.
