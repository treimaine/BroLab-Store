**File**: `__tests__/integration/reservation-flow.test.ts`

**Coverage**:

- Complete reservation creation flow with authenticated user
- Required field validation
- Checkout redirect flow with payment intent creation
- Session storage formatting
- Custom Beats service flow with authenticated user data
- Error scenarios (authentication, reservation creation, payment)
- Email notification flow (confirmation and admin notifications)
- Data consistency (field naming conventions)
- Service-specific flows for all services

**Tests**: 20 tests passing

### 3. Email Service Functionality Tests ✅

**File**: `__tests__/services/ReservationEmailService.test.ts`

**Coverage**:

- Reservation confirmation emails
- Admin notification emails
- Status update emails
- Payment confirmation emails
- Payment failure emails
- Reservation reminder emails

- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Service type formatting
- Multiple reservations handling

**Tests**: 22 tests passing

### 4. Error Scenario Tests ✅

**File**: `__tests__/reservation-error-scenarios.test.ts`

**Coverage**:

- Authentication errors (missing token, invalid token, expired session, user not found, ID mismatch)
- Validation errors (missing fields, invalid formats, past dates, invalid durations)
- Database errors (connection failure, timeout, duplicates, constraints)
- Payment errors (intent creation, insufficient funds, invalid card, timeout)
- Email errors (service unavailable, invalid recipient, timeout, SMTP failure)
- Network errors (timeout, connection refused, DNS failure, SSL errors)
- Rate limiting errors (too many requests, quota exceeded)
- File upload errors (file too large, invalid type, upload timeout, storage quota)
- Concurrency errors (time slot conflict, optimistic locking, race conditions)
- Business logic errors (outside business hours, duration limits, advance notice)
- Error recovery (retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, max retries)
- User-friendly error messages

**Tests**: 52 tests passing

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all reservation tests
npm test -- reservation --no-watch

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- __tests__/services/ReservationEmailService.test.ts --no-watch
npm test -- __tests__/integration/reservation-flow.test.ts --no-watch
npm test -- __tests__/convex/reservations/convex-reservation-functions.test.ts --no-watch
npm test -- __tests__/reservation-error-scenarios.test.ts --no-watch
```

## Notes

- All tests follow Jest best practices
- Tests are isolated and don't depend on external services
- Mocks are used appropriately for external dependencies
- Tests focus on core functional logic
- Error messages are validated for user-friendliness
- Tests validate both success and failure paths

## Conclusion

The reservation system now has comprehensive test coverage across all layers:

- ✅ Unit tests for individual functions
- ✅ Integration tests for complete flows
- ✅ Email service tests
- ✅ Error scenario tests
- ✅ Validation tests
- ✅ End-to-end tests

All requirements from the specification are covered by the test suite.
