# Convex and Clerk Integration - Complete Setup Summary

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Core Integration

- **Proper Convex-Clerk Authentication**: Set up ConvexProviderWithClerk with useAuth hook
- **Webhook Integration**: Created `convex/clerk/webhooks.ts` for user lifecycle management
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced Convex schema with comprehensive user and business data models
- **TypeScript Safety**: Implemented strict typing throughout the integration

### ✅ WooCommerce Integration

- **Sync Service**: Created `convex/sync/woocommerce.ts` for product synchronization
- **Server Service**: Built `server/services/WooCommerceService.ts` for API operations
- **Route Endpoints**: Added sync endpoints to `/api/woo/sync/products` and `/api/woo/sync/product/:id`
- **Data Transformation**: Proper mapping between WooCommerce products and Convex beats

### ✅ Code Cleanup

- **Removed Redundant Files**: Eliminated duplicate Clerk route handlers and middleware
- **Fixed Import Issues**: Cleaned up broken imports and dependencies
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Fixed most TypeScript errors for production readiness
- **Backup Creation**: All removed files were backed up with `.backup` extension

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### 1. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env`:

```bash
# Convex
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# Clerk
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# WooCommerce
WOOCOMMERCE_API_URL=https://brolabentertainment.com/wp-json/wc/v3
WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY=ck_...
WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET=cs_...
```

### 2. Clerk Webhook Configuration

Update your Clerk dashboard webhook URL to:

- **Development**: `https://your-convex-url.convex.cloud/clerk-webhook`
- **Production**: `https://your-convex-url.convex.cloud/clerk-webhook`

### 3. Deploy Convex Functions

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. Test WooCommerce Sync

```bash
# Sync all products
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/woo/sync/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"page": 1, "perPage": 10}'

# Sync single product
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/woo/sync/product/123
```

### 2. Test Clerk Integration

- Sign up/sign in through your app
- Check Convex dashboard for user creation
- Verify webhook events in Clerk dashboard

### 3. Test Client Hooks

```typescript
import { useCurrentUser, useFavorites } from "@/hooks/useConvex";

function MyComponent() {
  const { clerkUser, convexUser, isAuthenticated } = useCurrentUser();
  const favorites = useFavorites();

  // Your component logic
}
```
